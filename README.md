Congratulations! Your project meets all of the requirements.

Please, take care and keep on the nice work!

PS. Now that you have passed the project basic requirements, you may want to push your implementation further to make your project stands out. For instance, you could write your `process_image` node by using a class as illustrated in this [link](https://github.com/wsnewman/ros_class/tree/master/example_ros_class). Also, you could use [cv_bridge](http://wiki.ros.org/cv_bridge/Tutorials/UsingCvBridgeToConvertBetweenROSImagesAndOpenCVImages) to explore the possibility of detecting, and chase, a ball of any color using OpenCV. Please refer to [link 1](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/09/14/ball-tracking-with-opencv/) and [link 2](http://profs.scienze.univr.it/~bloisi/tutorial/balldetection.html) for more information.
